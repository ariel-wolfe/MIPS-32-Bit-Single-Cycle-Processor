# MIPS 32-Bit Single Cycle Processor

## Abstract
Designing a 32-bit MIPS single cycle processor to implement R-type and I-type formats. Each component of the processor was created using Quartus II VHDL software. The processor consisted of a PC, instruction memory, multiplexers, registers, ALUs, data memory, a sign extender, a shift left 2, and control units for##  the ALU and the processor. Each component was emulated and tested for functionality. Once all components were confirmed to function properly, the processor was assembled using a Quartus II block schematic that was made up of block symbols of each component of the full data path. The assembled processor was compiled successfully and verified to work properly. 

## Introduction
Using Altera Quartus to design a 32-bit MIPS single cycle processor. The processor is built to implement R-type and I-type formats for MIPS commands. The full data path consists of a PC, instruction memory, registers, ALUs, multiplexers, data memory, a sign extender, a shift left 2, and controls for the ALU and processor. Each component was designed using Quartus II VHDL and emulated with timing simulations to test for functionality. 

## Methods
The VHDL for each component was written to emulate the componentâ€™s functionality to assemble the circuit for the processor. The components were tested using timing simulations to verify the functionality of each component. The assembled processor was built using an Altera Quartus block diagram. The schematic was compiled and tested.
